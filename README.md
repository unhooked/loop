[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/loop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/loop)

This is the development repository for Firefox Hello, codenamed Loop. For
background information on Loop, please see our
[wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Loop). Loop is developed in two parts:

1. As an add-on that is then incorporated and shipped as a built-in part of
Firefox desktop. This provides a toolbar button, a panel, and a conversation
window.
2. As a web page (aka standalone client or link-clicker), that runs on its own
web server.
